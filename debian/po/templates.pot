#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"The man and mandb program can be installed with the set-user-id bit set, so "
"that they will run with the permissions of the 'man' user. This allows "
"ordinary users to benefit from the caching of preformatted manual pages "
"('cat pages'), and means that the database of man page descriptions is "
"automatically kept up to date by people reading man pages. Storing cat "
"pages, in particular, may aid performance on slower machines."

#. Description

msgid ""
"Cached man pages only work if you are using a \"normal\"-width terminal (66 "
"to 80 characters wide). This is to avoid one user causing cat pages to be "
"saved at widths that would be inconvenient for other users. In a future "
"release this will be configurable. Until then, if you use a wide terminal, "
"you can force man pages to be formatted to 80 characters anyway by setting "
"MANWIDTH=80."
