#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"The man and mandb program can be installed with the set-user-id bit set, so "
"that they will run with the permissions of the 'man' user. This allows "
"ordinary users to benefit from the caching of preformatted manual pages "
"('cat pages'), which may aid performance on slower machines."

"Cached man pages only work if you are using an 80-column terminal, to avoid "
"one user causing cat pages to be saved at widths that would be inconvenient "
"for other users. If you use a wide terminal, you can force man pages to be "
"formatted to 80 columns anyway by setting MANWIDTH=80."
