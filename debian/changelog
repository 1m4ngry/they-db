man-db (2.5.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backport from upstream (closes: #446189):
    - Connect up the decompression pipeline in the display_to_stdout case
      too.

man-db (2.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Remove /usr/X11R6/man from MANDATORY_MANPATH (closes: #413349).
    - man now supports the MANPAGER environment variable, overriding PAGER.
    - Resolve ambiguous error message when asking for a nonexistent manual
      page that might also be a section name (closes: #421481).
    - MANSEC -> MANSECT in German man(1) and catman(8) (closes: #430635).
    - Truncate apropos/whatis output to the terminal width by default
      (closes: #411721).
    - lexgrog now ignores alleged manual page names containing spaces, as
      these usually indicate parsing errors or ill-formed NAME sections and
      they clutter up apropos output badly.
    - Discard stderr from formatting processes when outputting to a pager,
      to avoid visual corruption from any error messages (closes: #372939).
    - Disallow sectional extensions of alphabetic sections, e.g. n and l
      from the default configuration (closes: #391977), and sectional
      extensions beginning with a digit (closes: #421481).
    - Suppress warnings in --quiet mode (closes: #348008, #378428, #411220;
      also closes: #334280 since that suggestion is no longer relevant).
    - If MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set in the environment, don't strip
      formatting characters with col (closes: #340673).
    - Implement and use a decompression library. This allows cat pages to be
      saved in the background while the pager is active (closes: #18452) and
      operation with a read-only /tmp (closes: #165499).
    - Add a configuration file flag (NOCACHE) to disable cat page caching
      (closes: #196642).
    - Add output keys to a hashtable, and skip any that have already been
      seen (closes: #259338).
    - Execute system utilities by command name rather than by full path
      (closes: #385651).
    - Add apropos -a/--and option to display only items matching all
      keywords (closes: #259340).
    - Adjust Finnish translation of "No manual entry for %s"
      (closes: #320108).
    - Create and use databases for non-English manual hierarchies
      (closes: #29448, #281811).
    - Improve per-locale directory handling. Directories such as "fr.UTF-8"
      may be used for occasions when it is appropriate to specify the
      character set but not the country, and so a full locale name is
      inconvenient.
    - There is a new "manconv" program which can try multiple possible
      encodings for a file, thus allowing UTF-8 manual pages to be installed
      in any directory even without an explicit encoding declaration.
    - Don't escape the hierarchy path while globbing; it isn't necessary and
      it causes problems for paths containing metacharacters
      (closes: #444187).
  * Use new configure options for external programs rather than hardcoding
    them in configure.ac.
  * Remove code in debian/rules to fiddle manual page paths for Debian,
    since the default of $LL.UTF-8 is now reasonable. (An
    announcement/discussion about what other Debian packages should do will
    be forthcoming shortly.)
  * Build-depend on zlib1g-dev so that we use zlib rather than gzip to
    decompress gzipped manual pages.

    - Tamil (thanks, Tirumurti Vasudevan; closes: #431063).
  * Override syntax-error-in-debian-changelog lintian warning. I'm not going
    to edit history from over eight years ago just for this.
  * Don't ignore errors from 'make distclean' other than the Makefile not
    existing.
  * Drop source-compatibility with woody.

man-db (2.4.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backport from upstream (closes: #420843):
    - lib/pipeline.c (pipeline_start): Don't ignore SIGPIPE in subprocesses;
      this has undesirable consequences in some situations.
      (pipeline_wait): Flatten SIGPIPE exit statuses to zero instead.

    - Avoid splitting up a sentence into two translatable pieces
      (closes: #320111).
    - Add Russian translation of NAME (thanks, Yuri Kozlov;
      closes: #338991).
    - Fix mistaken use of .l instead of .I (thanks, Valéry Perrin;
      closes: #349208).
    - Add Danish translation of NAME (thanks, Henning Makholm;
      closes: #353959).
    - Skip "exec" at the start of a command, to make old configuration files
      work (closes: #353959).
    - Ignore SIGPIPE in child processes (closes: #387864).
    - Fail with an error message if argv is a character or block device, as
      we may well hang trying to read from it and it almost certainly isn't
      what the caller intended anyway (closes: #341706).
    - Teach lexgrog front-end about pages with multiple name/description
      pairs (closes: #342834).
    - Fix a slew of memory leaks, including a nasty per-search leak in
      apropos (closes: #368749).
    - Add cross-references to mandb in apropos and whatis documentation
      (thanks, Phil Endecott; closes: #388755).
    - Document man -X option (thanks, Sam Morris; closes: #360112).

man-db (2.4.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT in the parent while running subprocesses
    (closes: #328982).
  * Improve SIGCHLD handling in pipeline library (closes: #326488):
    - Queue SIGCHLD for the whole time we're collecting child process
      statuses; we need to keep a careful count of processes.
    - Forget any previous errno before calling reap_children.
  * Explicitly tell po2debconf to use the 'popular' output encoding, so that
    the woody-compatibility hack works even with po-debconf 0.9.0.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Sep 2005 13:03:47 +0100

man-db (2.4.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use 'col -b -p -x' rather than just 'col -b' when stdout is not a

    www-browser package (closes: #321769).
  * Update debian/copyright with the FSF's new address.

man-db (2.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Make most calls to external programs directly rather than going via
      the shell.
    - When stdout is not a terminal, man pages will be formatted in plain
      text without the use of backspace or ANSI formatting characters.
    - Try harder to find somewhere to store cat pages for symlinked man
      pages (closes: #129575).
    - When invoking apropos (man -k) or whatis (man -f) as external
      programs, man now only passes through command-line options understood
      by the respective programs (closes: #207436).
    - Drop versions and/or modifiers from locale names before deciding how
      to handle them (closes: #241387).
    - Fix portable shell issues in mkcatdirs (closes: #256279).
    - Terminate NAME section parsing on encountering a macro definition
      (closes: #275562).
    - Add -s/--section option to apropos and whatis (closes: #218407).
    - Update Polish translation (thanks, Robert Luberda; closes: #245057).
    - Update Russian translation (thanks, Yuri Kozlov; closes: #268584).

man-db (2.4.2-13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * When sorting located man pages for display, sort by pure section, then
    id (real page, symlink, whatis reference, etc.), then extended section,
    rather than the previous ordering of extended section then id. This
    works around the worst effects of #204249, in which changing a
    cross-hierarchy man page alternative can cause man to get the display
    order wrong.

  * Increment groff-base dependency to 1.17.2-2, when the ascii8 device was
    moved there (closes: #225461). Drop the alternative groff dependency
    altogether; it only matters if you're trying to use sarge's man-db with
    a groff from before woody, and I'm unconvinced about trying to support
    that combination.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 30 Dec 2003 01:06:43 +0000

man-db (2.4.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix build with uClibc, which doesn't have canonicalize_file_name()
    (thanks, Erik Andersen; closes: #216631).
  * Speed up mandb's purging of obsolete entries by lots, after noticing
    that it was calling fnmatch() an obscene number of times. The directory
    cache is now kept sorted and binary-searched on lookup.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Nov 2003 22:35:30 +0000

man-db (2.4.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make upgrades from before 2.4.2-1 pay attention to the rebuild-database
    question rather than build-database, even though the names of database
    files have changed (closes: #213799).
  * Silence errors from mandb via man when there are unwriteable directories
    on the manpath (closes: #213832).
  * In fact, while we're at it, turn off MAN_DB_CREATES so that man never
    tries to create databases that don't already exist. Users can still run
    mandb to create them themselves for the benefit of apropos and whatis if
    it's appropriate, but filesystem lookup should normally be enough for
    reading man pages.

man-db (2.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Revamped locale support.
      + The encoding of source manual pages is no longer considered to be
        related to the encoding of the input passed to *roff or to *roff's
        terminal output device. iconv pipes are inserted where necessary to
        convert between encodings.
      + Avoid using -Tlatin1 in locales that don't support it, like C and
        *.ISO-8859-2 (closes: #163983, #168442).
    - 'man ./foo.1' behaves much more like 'man -l foo.1' (closes: #170512).
    - Directories found in strange places in manual hierarchies don't crash
      mandb (closes: #176645).
    - Clarify 'man -Tdevice' syntax in man(1) (closes: #186806).
    - Add -C switch to use a different configuration file (closes: #176522).
    - mandb now knows how to purge removed stray cat pages from the database
      (closes: #143632).
  * Climb off the Berkeley DB version treadmill and use GDBM instead, whose
    version churn is a lot less frequent, and which is smaller and more
    appropriate to the use man-db makes of its databases (closes: #177176).
  * debian/postinst: Remove old index.bt databases from /var/cache/man.
  * debian/copyright: Remove outdated claim to be a native package (thanks,
    Petr Hudec). Various other updates and corrections.
  * debian/changelog: Correct date of second-earliest entry (thanks again,
    Petr Hudec).

man-db (2.4.1-11) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix several security problems reported on BugTraq (closes: #203475):
    - Limit sscanf() calls to the appropriate buffer size while reading
      configuration file.
    - Allocate strings dynamically while finding the ultimate source of man
      pages, avoiding a couple of buffer overflows.
    - Die gracefully if MANPATH contains too many elements, as a stopgap
      measure until proper list handling can be added.

man-db (2.4.1-9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix detection of decompression programs so that man doesn't attempt to
    execute man pages (!) when it doesn't have a decompression program
    (thanks, Paul Slootman; closes: #196097).
  * Fall back to /usr/bin/compress if compress isn't installed on the build
    system.
  * Correct a misplaced free() in decompress() that mangled an error
    message.

    invocation (see #154958 and #191249).
  * Convert to po-debconf, including hacks for source package compatibility
    with woody.

man-db (2.4.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Return 0 from xcopy() if the source file doesn't exist, so that mandb
    creates databases when asked to update missing ones instead of bailing
    out (closes: #187314).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Apr 2003 16:44:54 +0100

man-db (2.4.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix stupid mistake in xcopy()'s error handling. Thanks to Adam Conrad
    for the use of his system (closes: #183102).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Mar 2003 22:02:51 +0000

man-db (2.4.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a segfault in the $PATH-searching code (closes: #182661).
  * Remove obsolete Suggests: groff-x11.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Feb 2003 10:26:30 +0000

man-db (2.4.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only emit the message pointing to undocumented(7) if the name the user
    is looking for is on the $PATH (closes: #176468).
  * Improve xcopy()'s error handling. This helps with #167159, although
    apparently I'll have to move to db 4.1 to fix it completely.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Feb 2003 17:08:38 +0000

man-db (2.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop privileges in display_pages() when trying to display a page from a
    user manpath. (This isn't a security problem, as privileges were still
    correctly dropped while running external programs like pagers. However,
    it meant that non-world-readable user manpaths were inaccessible using a
    setuid man.)
  * Recode this changelog to UTF-8.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Jan 2003 03:25:29 +0000

man-db (2.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some cases of uninitialized mandata structs (closes: #151873).
  * Restore the undocumented(7) message; 2.4.1 implements it using a
    configure flag which I forgot to add.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Dec 2002 01:06:57 +0000

man-db (2.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "no, the apropos segfaults weren't my fault" release.
  * New upstream release.
    - Add new -W/--where-cat option and arrange for -w to print out only the
      location of the nroff page, to make parsing easier (closes: #156558).
    - Remove some global variable abuse in the detection of preprocessors
      (closes: #153794).
    - Export $MAN_PN to the pager (closes: #158658).
    - Fix character set lookups again (closes: #158752).
    - Add bzip2 decompression support (closes: #159994). Note that this
      doesn't mean packages should use it: Debian policy still mandates
      gzip, and bzip2 is neither Essential: yes nor depended on by man-db.
    - Print an error message and continue when a decompression command
      fails, rather than immediately returning CHILD_FAIL (closes: #141981).
    - Clarify the purpose of section 7 as "Miscellaneous" (closes: #161505).
    - Rewrite the whatis parsing and storing code in check_mandirs.c so that
      I can actually understand it, and fix some spurious pointer loops in
      the process (closes: #163030).
    - Avoid over-enthusiastic access() check on stdin, so that 'man -X -l -'
      works (thanks, Peter Muir; closes: #167446).
    - Escape man page names when globbing, so that [(1) works properly
      (closes: #168129).
    - Fix a slightly misfiring check for $LANGUAGE (closes: #171513).
    - Detect and rebuild databases with the multi key corruption fixed in
      2.4.0-7 (closes: #165625).
  * './configure --enable-mandirs=GNU' is no longer necessary; the configure
    script figures it out automatically.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun, 22 Dec 2002 19:43:37 +0000

man-db (2.4.0-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove weak alias foolishness from lib/strnlen.c, so that man-db can
    build on BSD.
  * Add advice to the "No manual entry for %s" message to the effect that
    help for undocumented features can be found in undocumented(7). This is
    an experimental Debian-specific hack for now to help with #39830, but
    can be pushed upstream in time.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Nov 2002 01:04:03 +0000

man-db (2.4.0-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * datum.dsize needs to be size_t, not int. This broke s390x, which is
    64-bit and big-endian (thanks, Bastian Blank).
  * Policy version 3.5.7:
    - Drop DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=debug, and support noopt instead.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Sep 2002 21:32:30 +0100

man-db (2.4.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't fail whatis parse upon encountering EOF in the NAME section of a
    man page (closes: #160102).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Sep 2002 19:23:29 +0100

man-db (2.4.0-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recover if /var/cache/man has been deleted (closes: #159665).
  * Get rid of spurious "fopen: no such file or directory" message.
  * Fix '/usr/share/common-license' typo.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Sep 2002 22:59:55 +0100

man-db (2.4.0-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix segfault with uninitialized info.name and info.filter when scanning
    stray cats (thanks, Brendan O'Dea).
  * Fix database corruption when deleting one of a group of pages with the
    same name from the database. Existing corruption isn't repaired
    automatically; if you get "bad fetch on multi key" errors, run 'mandb
    --create' as the 'man' user to rebuild the database from scratch
    (closes: #159451).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue,  3 Sep 2002 20:41:56 +0100

man-db (2.4.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use --quiet in cron jobs rather than redirecting mandb's stdout and
    stderr to /dev/null (closes: #133185).
  * Point the cron jobs and postinst at /usr/bin/mandb rather than
    /usr/lib/man-db/mandb. At some point /usr/lib/man-db is going to go
    away, as it's no longer necessary; make sure to bring /etc/cron.*/man-db
    up to date if you've changed them manually.
  * Compare $DEBIAN_FRONTEND case-insensitively (closes: #154764).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Aug 2002 01:42:17 +0100

man-db (2.4.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix segfault when man is asked to display a page that is a dangling
    symlink (closes: #151974).
  * Improve error message when asked to display a nonexistent page whose
    name begins with 'n' or 'l' (which are also section names).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Jul 2002 21:34:04 +0100

man-db (2.4.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure the loop that scans for per-system manpaths if $SYSTEM is set
    always makes progress (closes: #151270).
  * Install man/THANKS.
  * Update David Martínez' e-mail address.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed,  3 Jul 2002 22:52:13 +0000

man-db (2.4.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include a bug/reportbug presubj hook to encourage the inclusion of
    --debug output in bug reports.
  * Fix the "9wm problem" for good (I hope). In the default configuration,
    man will now essentially assume that anything beginning with a digit is
    a section, but fall back and try it as a name if that doesn't work. So
    'man 9wm fvwm' will look for fvwm(9wm) and then try 9wm(1) and fvwm(1)
    when that fails, while 'man 3perl Shell' will display Shell(3perl). This
    will now work even if man hasn't been explicitly told that 3perl is a
    valid section (closes: #151283).
  * Don't list 3tcl and 3tk in /etc/manpath.config any more, as this
    workaround is now unnecessary (see #115345).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 29 Jun 2002 14:20:18 +0000

man-db (2.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't ask rebuild-database question twice on upgrade (closes: #151131).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Jun 2002 10:00:01 +0000

man-db (2.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Restructure the code that finds man pages to allow more flexibility.
      Man pages are now located first, then sorted properly before they are
      displayed (closes: #107946, #146696).
    - Case-insensitive lookups are now the default, although they can be
      disabled with -I or --match-case (closes: #108410). The database
      format had to be changed to support this, so existing databases will
      need to be rebuilt; debconf will ask about this at medium priority. In
      the process, move from libdb2 to libdb3.
    - Add a new -E/--encoding option to select different nroff devices
      (closes: #123994).
    - Use groff's utf8 device if the current locale specifies the UTF-8
      character set (closes: #129783).
    - Various changes that help with displaying output from the forthcoming
      groff 1.18. In particular, the -R flag is passed to less - shout if
      this causes any problems.
    - Work around libdb delays on zero-length databases (closes: #137908).
    - Add $MANLESS, which can be used to override all of man's
      do-what-I-mean code for setting $LESS (closes: #141403).
    - 'apropos --wildcard' anchors on word boundaries by default. Use
      --exact as well to revert to the old behaviour (closes: #37686).

    - Mention ps and utf8 groff output devices in man(1) (closes: #123997).
    - Document mandb's exit codes in its man page (closes: #111851).
    - Set less's -M prompt as well as its -m prompt (closes: #123312).
    - Give the correct page titles to less when man is invoked recursively
      (closes: #139155).
    - Use .BR for references in manpage.example (closes: #143389).

  * Stop using the wrapper that squashed root privileges down to uid man. It
    didn't provide any real security benefits in my opinion, and caused too
    many problems (closes: #58112, #74790).
  * Updated German and Brazilian Portuguese debconf translations (thanks,
    Sebastian Rittau and Andre Luis Lopes).
  * Correct path to text manual in doc-base file, and mention some more
    formats (thanks, Robert Luberda; closes: #149547).
  * start-stop-daemon isn't available when running from debootstrap. Use
    perl in the postinst instead to drop privileges in this case (thanks to
    Torsten Landschoff for the idea).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Jun 2002 15:40:32 +0000

man-db (2.3.20-20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix Catalan debconf translation (thanks, Jordi Mallach;
    closes: #140294).
  * Always build the database on fresh installations. Bug #100616 is now
    avoided by starting mandb in the foreground if DEBIAN_FRONTEND =
    Noninteractive; I originally thought this was also set when using the
    noninteractive frontend normally outside the installer, which apparently
    isn't the case.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 15 May 2002 23:07:58 +0100

man-db (2.3.20-19) unstable; urgency=low

  * debconf translations:
    - Add Catalan (thanks, Antoni Bella; closes: #140294).
    - Update Russian (thanks, Ilgiz Kalmetev; closes: #140886).
  * debian/cron.daily: Force /var/cache/man to be owned by man, just in case
    something else changed it (closes: #129340). If you want the cat
    directories to be owned by some other user, use dpkg-statoverride on
    /var/cache/man to set this; cron.daily won't touch them then.
  * debian/control: Depend on dpkg (>= 1.9.0) for the exit status of
    'dpkg-statoverride --list'.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  4 May 2002 20:28:27 +0100

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Mar 2002 21:10:43 +0000

man-db (2.3.20-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "mad-db" release.
  * Move section 2 in front of the extensions for scripting languages in
    section 3 by default, at the request of the Perl maintainer.
  * Install DVI and PostScript versions of the manual, for ease of printing
    (closes: #134926).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Feb 2002 09:20:04 +0000

man-db (2.3.20-14) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix segfault due to reusing a freed pointer in some cases of pages with
    multiple names. Thanks to Eirik Fuller for an excellent piece of
    analysis (closes: #123130).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Feb 2002 01:25:17 +0000

man-db (2.3.20-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Danish translation (thanks, Morten Brix Pedersen; closes: #122674).
  * Add Danish debconf translation (thanks, Claus Hindsgaul and Rune B.
    Broberg; closes: #126606).
  * Update Spanish debconf translation (thanks, José Luis González
    González).
  * Delete spurious backslashes in the less prompt string (closes: #122355).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Jan 2002 03:10:06 +0000

man-db (2.3.20-12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add some text to the install-setuid debconf note to explain that cat
    pages only work with "normal" terminal widths, to avoid the denial of
    service attack where you cause a cat page to be saved for a
    one-character-wide terminal, and that you can override its terminal
    width detection using $MANWIDTH. This alleviates #121997, although
    there's still a wishlist there to allow the width of cat pages on the
    system to be configurable.
  * Remove po/fr.gmo in the clean target: binary files can't go in the diff.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  1 Dec 2001 19:41:54 +0000

man-db (2.3.20-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * French translation update (thanks, Laurent Pelecq).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Nov 2001 19:58:44 +0000

man-db (2.3.20-10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * copy_datum() explicitly null-terminates data returned by libdb2, which
    avoids some rare and hard-to-trace segfaults. Many thanks to Manuel
    Estrada Sainz for his patience in allowing me to use his system to debug
    this over a period of several weeks (closes: #115219, #117009).
  * Keep a private hashtable of keys we've received from the database in the
    btree code, and return NULL if we get one we've seen already. Although
    this slows down database access somewhat, I hope it should get rid of
    problems with looped databases for good (closes: #116785).
  * Avoid nested calls to strtok() (closes: #119041).
  * Don't try to strappend() a string to itself while processing a MANPATH
    containing "::" (closes: #119098).
  * Display a more useful error message if asked to display a directory
    (closes: #120047).
  * Stop a memory leak in decompress().
  * configure detects that nroff is groff even if /bin/sh is ash.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Nov 2001 01:56:01 +0000

man-db (2.3.20-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop privileges when reading temporary file to find the list of
    preprocessors (closes: #117037).
  * Axiom: any bug in man-db may be fixed by additional calls to
    drop_effective_privs().

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Nov 2001 11:34:53 +0000

man-db (2.3.20-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force build-time pager detection to return /usr/bin/pager, even if for
    some reason it doesn't exist (closes: #117246).
  * Actually remember to run autoconf this time.
  * Add 3tcl and 3tk sections to /etc/manpath.config as a workaround until
    extensions work properly (closes: #115345).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Nov 2001 10:46:44 +0000

man-db (2.3.20-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Drop privileges throughout format_display(), and fix use of freed memory
    while printing the resulting error message (closes: #117168).

man-db (2.3.20-5) unstable; urgency=low

man-db (2.3.20-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Release Manager: this bug has been in man-db since 2.3.18-3, and meant
    that new installations of woody had broken cat directories by default.
    It really needs to beat the base system freeze.
  * mandb: correctly chown newly created cat directories to man when running
    as root (closes: #113764).
  * debian/postinst: chown everything in /var/cache/man to man if upgrading
    from older versions.
  * Build with -Wall.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Sep 2001 14:52:25 +0100

man-db (2.3.20-3) unstable; urgency=low

man-db (2.3.20-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * lexgrog: Stop the '.' no-op request from eating text on the next line
    (it caused problems before .SH NAME), and trim whitespace better.
    Urgency medium to match the recent groff upload that tickles this.
  * man: Drop privileges throughout local_man_loop() (closes: #111939).
  * Various documentation updates, including referring to man(7) from man(1)
    and adding some more advice to manpage.example* (thanks, Andreas Dilger;

  * Policy version 3.5.6.

man-db (2.3.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Improve lexgrog so that its output is more machine-parseable, give it
      a man page, and move it to /usr/bin.
    - mandb's --create option implies --no-purge, to avoid problems when
      recreating broken databases (closes: #110738, important).
    - man doesn't segfault if LANGUAGE is set but empty (closes: #110309).
    - Support 'man --html', with ESR's $BROWSER specification and David A.
      Wheeler's modifications for improved security (closes: #108143).
    - Reword part of apropos(1) (thanks, Daniel Patterson; closes: #110468).
  * Release Manager: we've had most of the code in this release already in
    the 2.3.19 series. The lexgrog changes here will be very useful for
    tools like lintian, perhaps in time for woody; the code affected by
    implementing $BROWSER was previously unsupported.
  * All translations (both gettext and man pages) are now very out of date.
    Please contact me if you can help.
  * debian/rules: Simplify install target; upstream clock-skew bug fixed.

man-db (2.3.19-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Escape shell arguments properly to cope with spaces in man page names
    (closes: #27492, #50107).
  * Honour more than one MANPATH_MAP entry per $PATH element, providing of
    course that the manpath exists (closes: #108979).
  * Set roff_device to ascii8 and LESSCHARSET to iso8859 for Korean (thanks,
    Ho-seok Lee; closes: #109598, #109599).
  * Display an error if setlocale() fails.
  * Switch off --html option properly, as it doesn't work very well yet
    anyway. The -Thtml option still works.
  * Fix count of purged whatis references.
  * src/wrapper.c: Include <grp.h> for initgroups().

  * debian/control: Improve language of description.
  * debian/copyright: Minor updates. Mention Markus Armbruster.
  * debian/rules: Build and install /usr/lib/man-db/lexgrog; it's handy for
    testing purposes.

man-db (2.3.19-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve creation of temporary files by using mkstemp() rather than
    tempnam(), and by falling back to /tmp if $TMPDIR is unwriteable

  * Clean up manpage.example, and install new examples of man pages written
    in POD and DocBook SGML (closes: #96781).
  * Include /var/cache/man directory in the .deb. I probably won't install
    anything beneath that manually, as it's better that mandb creates them
    on the fly as required (closes: #75868).
  * Part of 2.3.18-7 accidentally got lost in 2.3.19-1. Here it is again:
    - configure.in falls back to standard paths for col, grap, lynx, and
      vgrind, so we don't need those as build dependencies any more.
  * Make lexgrog no longer misfire on lowercase versions of the various
    groff requests that indicate the use of tbl, eqn, etc.

  * Allow whatis entries to point to themselves. This sometimes happens when
    multiple names and descriptions are present, and it's easier to tolerate
    this.
  * Prepend to $LESS rather than appending to it, so that long options work
    (closes: #83594).
  * Set the modification time of each cat page to be the same as that of the
    corresponding man page, and regenerate cat pages if the modtime differs
    rather than if it's newer (closes: #22358, #93659).

man-db (2.3.19-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * A bracketing typo made determine_lang_table() never detect anything
    except the fallback language. This completely broke at least Japanese
    (closes: #103808).

man-db (2.3.19-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "laptop envy (damn tbm for having a nicer one than me)" release.

  * New upstream release. Highlights:
    - Security fix: make sure decisions about whether to drop privileges are
      never taken based on the user configuration file ~/.manpath.
    - The ordering of manual sections is now configurable at run-time, using
      SECTION directives in the configuration file. This should kill the
      last traces of the old 9term(1) bug (closes: #3766, yay!).
    - man will no longer try to keep its database caches up to date, even if
      it's setuid. No more speed problems, we hope! Instead, it will fall
      back to file globbing if database lookups fail. Whatis references will
      no longer work if the database isn't up to date enough to contain
      them, but I filed bugs on all packages this affects a while ago.
    - The globbing is done per-section, so newly installed manual pages will
      be noticed properly now (closes: #10106).
    - Thanks to some code from another man program, manual pages are now
      formatted to an appropriate line length when viewed on a terminal.
      Non-standard sizes aren't saved as cat pages. Page lengths are already
      resized with recent versions of groff (closes: #25410, #53993).
    - mandb(8) now documents how whatis parsing might fail (closes: #77727).
    - Whatis parsing treats fill requests correctly (closes: #97916) and
      ignores the no-op groff request '.' (closes: #101330).
    - Avoid infinite recursion if the database is corrupted such that an
      entry points to itself, which I believe shouldn't happen any more
      anyway (closes: #102181).
    - Let mandb update system databases as root as well as the man user
      (closes: #102250).
    - Downgrade warning if a manpath element doesn't exist to a debugging
      message (closes: #102402); likewise for the warning about relying on
      whatis refs being deprecated (see #102678).
    - Fixed some details of parsing NAME sections with multiple names in man
      pages with multiple symlinks to them (closes: #102678).
    - mandb knows how to delete obsolete entries from the database now,
      which should help to clean up the effects of old bugs like the above.
      This can be disabled with --no-purge.

  * Add Spanish debconf translation (thanks, Carlos Valdivia Yagüe;
    closes: #102156).
  * Add 'mandb --no-purge' invocation in cron.daily, so that apropos and
    whatis will continue to work mostly as expected. Since --create isn't
    used any more, it should be quite fast. This should alleviate most
    problems caused by turning off automatic database updates. A cron.weekly
    entry remains which also purges old database entries.
  * Add SECTION entries for 3pm and 3perl to make sure Perl modules come
    before core (this was formerly set at compile-time).
  * The .deb doesn't contain setuid binaries any more, so remove the lintian
    overrides.

man-db (2.3.18-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix handling of symlinks pointing outside a mantree to relative .so
    links, which should then be interpreted as pointing back inside the
    mantree (ugh). ult_src() relied on a restriction I removed in 2.3.17.1-5
    (closes: #101559).
  * Fix format string bug in zsoelim (closes: #102001).
  * Use start-stop-daemon instead of su in cron.daily too (closes: #101892).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Jun 2001 16:07:39 +0100

man-db (2.3.18-9) unstable; urgency=high

  * While configuring, if the database is missing and we aren't setuid,
    don't build it; it will probably get out of date quickly anyway. This
    involves substantial debconf rearrangements, and I examine the seen flag
    so I need debconf (>= 0.5). Urgency high because the boot-floppies were
    having trouble with mandb starting in the background (closes: #100616).
  * When starting mandb in the background, use start-stop-daemon rather than
    su to avoid spurious syslog output. --nicelevel needs dpkg (>= 1.8.0).

  * manpath(1): s/semicolon/colon/ (thanks, Gordon Sadler; closes: #100362).
  * Comment out code supporting the man page hierarchy organization of other
    operating systems, as it sometimes misfires on Debian (e.g. dpkg(8) vs.
    dpkg.rb(1)). This will be solved more neatly upstream (closes: #99766).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 13 Jun 2001 16:08:04 +0100

man-db (2.3.18-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix infinite loop in pathappend() if man pages are present for both a
    given language and that language with a country code (closes: #100119).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Jun 2001 18:13:36 +0100

man-db (2.3.18-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Folded in changelog entry from 2.3.16-4 security update. The backport
    was from upstream 2.3.18, so the vulnerability didn't apply to unstable.
  * Allow .PP etc. as well as .br between whatis definitions (e.g. pod2man).
  * Make straycats use 'col -bx' rather than 'col-bx' (thanks, Matt Kraai;
    closes: #98923).
  * The response to the above was a rather excessive exit(). straycats
    should now continue gracefully instead (thanks, Andrew Suffield).
  * Fix silly date format in man-db's English man pages.
  * pathappend() now eliminates duplicate manpaths (closes: #99667).
  * configure.in falls back to standard paths for col, grap, lynx, and
    vgrind, so we don't need those as build dependencies any more.
  * groff has been split! Depend on the base package, suggest the others.
  * The previous fix for #47000 only worked for read-only directories, not
    read-only filesystems. Fix it harder.
  * gettext seems to be broken with the new autoconf. Hack it for now.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Jun 2001 18:27:24 +0100

man-db (2.3.18-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note in man-db/build-database and man-db/rebuild-database templates that
    the build will happen in the background and possibly slow down
    installation of other packages (closes: #71931).
  * Bump priority of man-db/rebuild-database (not man-db/build-database)
    question to medium.

  * Various updates from CVS for autoconf 2.50.
  * Avoid autoconf build-dep by touching configure and stamp-h.in in build
    and clean (ugh - remember to run the autotools manually).
  * Improved configure's checks for Berkeley DB to correctly handle newer
    headers with dbopen() defined as a macro (thanks, Duncan Simpson).

  * Fix a thinko in whatis parsing that meant "foo," would sometimes be
    stored in the database alongside "foo".
  * If we can't write to a cat page (e.g. man isn't setuid), don't bother to
    open a compressor to /dev/null, so that man can abort straight away
    rather than formatting whole pages into the bit-bucket when a user quits
    the pager early (closes: #98528).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 26 May 2001 20:26:25 +0100

man-db (2.3.18-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove /usr/bin/man and /usr/bin/mandb on prerm remove (closes: #98221).
  * Stop using statoverrides in the postinst, as it's too hard to tell
    between maintainer-script-installed overrides and admin-installed
    overrides. Instead use ordinary chown/chmod (thanks, Michal Politowski;
    closes: #98224).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 21 May 2001 22:52:05 +0100

man-db (2.3.18-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Call db_stop in the postinst, just to be safe. I have a feeling
    redirecting stdout and stderr to /dev/null when running mandb might not
    be enough.
  * Don't remove catdirs in the postinst, even if we're upgrading from old
    versions that did that.
  * Remove some output in the postinst - whoops. Upgrades from <= 2.3.17.1-5
    to 2.3.18-3 were probably broken.
  * If it turns out that we have to (re)build the database, ask a
    low-priority debconf question about it (defaulting to yes). Rebuilding
    should happen much less often now in any case (closes: #74579).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun, 20 May 2001 19:34:55 +0100

man-db (2.3.18-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * So, I flame Peter T. Breuer on Usenet for his bug report being several
    bugs rolled up into one and being full of flamage itself. Then I think,
    well, since I'm ranting about it, I may as well see if I can fix it. Of
    course, it now turns out that fixing that was key to a load of other
    bugs. So I apologize to Peter and promise, again, to write the code
    before spouting off in future. :)
  * If opening a database or a cat page fails due to a lack of permissions
    (e.g. a read-only partition), recover gracefully and only complain about
    it in debug mode (addresses part of bug #47000).
  * Improved documentation of MANDB_MAP directives in /etc/manpath.config
    (addresses the other part of that bug, so closes: #47000).

  * Once man and mandb don't complain about certain classes of permission
    problems, it becomes easy to install them non-setuid. Since in this mode
    man can't write cat pages or update the database on the fly, non-setuid
    is the default but a debconf question asks whether to install them
    setuid. I hope this meets the concerns about man-db's security policy
    (closes: #42128).
  * As well as the above, the recent security updates should have made sure
    that man and mandb drop privileges at the right times, and so can read
    privately-owned directories (closes: #42479, #42791).
  * In non-setuid mode there's no need to use the root-squashing wrapper.
    I'm not going to close related bugs yet, as they're still present for
    those who install setuid; I still intend to split the setuid stuff out
    into a separate process and remove the wrapper entirely.
  * The postinst and cron.weekly now explicitly su to man to run mandb,
    since the wrapper might not be present.
  * If searching for a page in the database returns no output, check the
    filesystem anyway, as the database might not be up to date.

  * Tidied up parsing of multiple whatis keys in .SH NAME sections, so that
    each separate name gets assigned its own whatis entry correctly.
    Separating items in the NAME section with newlines remains unsupported,
    as at the moment man pages can get away with spreading their whatis
    description over multiple lines and I'd rather not break them
    gratuitously. However, multiple items will be recognized (and have been
    for a long time, albeit brokenly up to now) if they are separated by a
    .br (break) request. *roff doesn't normally do much with newlines in the
    middle of paragraphs in its input, so this is consistent. See bug #97916
    for more details (closes: #17735).

  * Updated tools/config.sub to know about the sh/sheb architectures.

man-db (2.3.18-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * man would segfault if the argument to -S contained only colons, and
    incidentally treated an empty argument to -S wrongly. Both cases now use
    the standard list of sections instead (thanks, Colin Phipps and Stephen
    Shirley; closes: #97553, #97566).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 15 May 2001 19:36:12 +0100

man-db (2.3.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, incorporating changes from Wilf's 2.3.11 and
    2.3b12 releases as well as all my upstream-relevant changes to date. At
    long last the Debian diff is a manageable size.
  * Build the manual from the original nroff source. HTML is gone for now,
    until I can get satisfactory output from grohtml.
  * Remove build dependency on html2text as a result of the above.
  * Build-depend on lynx, as configure checks for its path.
  * jgroff no longer exists, so drop the alternative dependency on it.
  * Remove debian/rules cruft to generate configure, which is now definitely
    built upstream.

  * The configuration file is now partially automatically generated, and is
    called man_db.conf upstream. The Debian package still uses
    manpath.config for now to save me having to do the hacking necessary to
    move a conffile.
  * According to FHS 2.1, the location of locally installed man pages is
    /usr/local/share/man rather than /usr/local/man. The upstream
    configuration file now has /usr/local/man mapped to
    /var/cache/man/oldlocal and /usr/local/share/man mapped to
    /var/cache/man/local. Move .../local to .../oldlocal in the postinst to
    save regenerating cat pages.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 15 May 2001 00:00:56 +0100

man-db (2.3.17.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Formally took over upstream maintenance. No release yet, but updated
    debian/copyright with new location of upstream source (and also Wilf's
    distribution site for old sources).
  * Generate man-db-manual.txt from man-db-manual.html at build time using
    html2text, rather than including it in the diff. (The next upstream
    release will have both generated from the original nroff source.)
  * Don't run configure in the clean rule, and ignore errors due to not
    finding the makefile. In normal autobuilds it just wastes time.

  * Bumped database format version to 2.3.2. This really should have been
    done a long time ago.
  * If database information is found to be in an old format, then ignore it
    and use the filesystem instead. mandb will fix it up when it's run, as
    it is in the postinst (although this may well become optional soon).
  * Explicitly close the database if the version number is wrong, so that
    the above works.
  * Lower warnings about wrong version numbers to debugging messages.
  * All hail debootstrap for making the testing above so painless!

  * Taught lexgrog how to detect grap and vgrind. Preprocessor lines (with
    '\", see man(1)) are no longer strictly necessary for these. It's still
    good practice to declare what preprocessors your man page needs if it
    uses any - even tbl - for compatibility with older versions of man.
  * History updates for the man pages.
  * Made accessdb check for /var/cache/man in preference to /var/catman, and
    updated the man page accordingly. (Incidentally, I'd have preferred it
    if the Japanese translator hadn't improvised text that wasn't in the
    English version, as now I don't know how to update it to keep up with
    this change. Please don't do this in future.)
  * Fixed the --test option to mandb (it really doesn't alter existing
    databases now), and documented it. It should be almost feasible to use
    it for lintian checks now, if need be (closes: #5360).
  * Generate a warning if displaying a page requires going through a whatis
    reference with no link in the filesystem. Supporting this is necessarily
    a major performance hog; see policy bug #94995 for more information.
  * Removed code preventing symlinks outside a mantree from working. I can't
    see how it's a security problem, and in some situations (e.g. stow) such
    symlinks are useful (closes: #94642).

man-db (2.3.17.1-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Drop privileges in mandb when creating a temporary database in a
    user-supplied manual hierarchy. Thanks to Ethan Benson for observing
    this vulnerability.
  * This was also fixed in 2.3.16-3 in potato; folded in changelog entries
    from security updates.

  * I noticed a stray /etc/cron.weekly/catman on my system. Although it was
    definitely from this package, I can't quite work out from the changelog
    when it was removed. At any rate, it's obsolete, so clean it up.
  * Removed a spurious space in accessdb's usage output.
  * whatis/apropos: Complain and exit immediately if a key in the database
    is missing its value, indicating database corruption. Also disable
    optimized btree walk for now, as seq() seems to be more tolerant of this
    than get() for reasons I haven't tracked down yet (closes: #95052).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Apr 2001 23:53:42 +0100

man-db (2.3.17.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move the wrapper from /usr/bin/man-wrapper to /usr/lib/man-db/wrapper,
    since there's no reason to execute it directly. This also means we can
    lose man-wrapper(1), which wasn't terribly informative anyway.
  * Make "bad symlink" output quieter (2.3.17.1-1 made it noisier by
    mistake).
  * Use the latin1 character set again for the C and POSIX locales.
  * Updated Japanese translations (thanks, UCHIDA Norihiro; closes: #76774).
    The ja_JP.ujis directory is still present, as a Debian diff can't remove
    it. I'll remove it in the next upstream release.
  * The order of locale variable checking was corrected some time ago by
    calling setlocale(LC_ALL, ""). Added support for the case where
    LC_MESSAGES is set differently from other categories, and for selecting
    multiple locale preferences with LANGUAGE (thanks, Claudio S. Suarez
    Sanchez and Tomohiro KUBOTA; closes: #40743).
  * Correct first line of /etc/manpath.config (closes: #94090).
  * Make /etc/manpath.config a dpkg-handled conffile and dispose of the hack
    to convert old configuration files to the FHS.
    /usr/share/man-db/chconfig is still there if people want to use it.
  * util-linux (essential) has provided /usr/bin/pager since version 2.7.1-1
    in September 1997. I think we can safely assume it's there now.
  * Don't preserve the configure script any more; just generate it each
    time. It should go in the next upstream tarball.
  * Updated --version output, and fixed configure to find the version number
    properly.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Apr 2001 15:23:30 +0100

man-db (2.3.17.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really fix makefile permissions. It looks like makefile was only in the
    Debian diff, not the .orig.tar.gz, so there's no need to preserve it to
    avoid a massive diff (closes: #90302 again).
  * Just update the database in cron.weekly rather than creating it from
    scratch. If the database format changes, the postinst will sort it out;
    if the database becomes corrupt, you're going to want to fix it more
    quickly than next week anyway (closes: #39842).
  * 'apropos -w' really does wildcard matches now (thanks, KAMBAYASHI
    Hiroyuki; closes: #77624).
  * Updated docs/ToDo (using zlib rather than gzip would be good).

man-db (2.3.17.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New maintainer. Fabrizio, may the road rise up to meet you.
  * Might as well acknowledge my NMUs (closes: #41915, #60084, #60867;
    closes: #61198, #71797, #71932, #72292, #76107, #78086, #83019, #84128;
    closes: #84334, #84926, #85049, #85314, #85421, #85463, #85812, #86108;
    closes: #86892, #87195, #87420, #87541).

  * Converted to debhelper, and otherwise substantially rewrote the build
    process. debian/{p.skeleton,policy,source-depends} are gone, and
    debian/conffiles too as debhelper v3 handles that.
  * Unfortunately, much of the debian/ directory was in the upstream
    tarball, and dpkg-source ignores deletions. To get around this, I made a
    new "upstream" tarball, which is identical to 2.3.17 except without the
    debianization (hence the sub-sub-minor revision).
  * debian/rules:
    - Preserve ownership and permissions while copying files in the clean
      target to avoid inadvertent root ownership (closes: #90302).
    - Really set LDFLAGS, and pass it at the build stage rather than in
      configure so that I can get unstripped binaries easily.
    - DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=debug was broken due to missing quotes. Fixed.
  * debian/{pre,post}{inst,rm}:
    - Reformatted somewhat and removed things debhelper does already.
    - Removed call to update-menus in postrm.
    - Only rebuild the database when the database format has changed or the
      database is missing, and only remove catpages on purge. Hacked preinst
      to deal with old packages' postrms removing catpages unconditionally.
    - No need to su to run mandb; man-wrapper will sort that out.
    - Clean up a cron job left around from the old man package in rex
      (closes: #67000).
  * Updated policy version to 3.5.2: no changes required.
  * Depend on bsdmainutils rather than just suggesting it. Users might
    legitimately want stray cats (pages, that is ...) on their system, even
    if they aren't installed by Debian packages (closes: #64183).
  * Added lintian overrides (setuid-binary /usr/lib/man-db/{man,mandb} 4755
    man/root).
  * Clarified manpage.example (thanks, Kevin Ryde; closes: #52525).

  * Call setlocale() with LC_ALL rather than LC_MESSAGES (patch from GOTO
    Masanori; closes: #75559). If somebody with experience of locale
    programming could tell me whether the patch in #40743 makes sense, it
    would be much appreciated.
  * The Perl maintainer is putting core Perl module man pages in the .3perl
    namespace, so that should follow .3pm (to allow vendor pages to shadow
    core). Added that to include/manconfig.h.in.
  * Significantly improved man's behaviour when new packages are installed
    and it decides to rescan the man hierarchies. Its logic for working out
    what pages it had seen before and put in its database didn't quite cope
    with symlinks, so every link to undocumented(7) and so on got rescanned
    and gunzipped. Fixed the logic in all but pathological cases (.so links
    to symlinks, say, but Don't Do That Then). If a lot of manual pages have
    been changed recently, it still reads them all, but this should be a lot
    less painful now.

man-db (2.3.17-3.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Quieten cron.weekly again. Even if I'd remembered --quiet, it will still
    report real errors in the man page hierarchy, such as broken symlinks;
    there are quite a lot of those in Debian right now, and it isn't
    important enough to mail root about it every week (will reopen #28828,
    but closes: #87541).
  * Change to the root directory so cron.daily doesn't get "Permission
    denied" (closes: #87195, #87694).
  * More *roff and /dev/null fixes in configure. This one restores the
    mandoc macros so that PostScript output looks sensible again
    (closes: #87420).
  * Build-depend on grap and vgrind so we always get paths to them.
  * Improved description of -M option in man page (closes: #71932).
  * Corrected a couple of "it's" -> "its" typos.
  * The FHS transition took place almost two years ago, but the code for
    updating manpath.config is still around. The configuration file is now
    only updated when the previous version of man-db was earlier than
    2.3.10-69j, and config_md5 is no longer dynamically updated in
    debian/rules based on the current build machine. Also move chconfig and
    config_md5 into /usr/share/man-db.

  * Migrate from suidregister to dpkg-statoverride (closes: #85049, #86108).
  * Do the 'make install' step manually in debian/rules. On a clock-skewed
    machine, the existing code would decide to rebuild the binaries and end
    up hardwiring the temporary build directory into them. This caused
    problems in an Alpha security upload; that was fixed binary-only, but
    this should prevent it recurring (closes: #85421, #85463, #85812).
  * Worked around change in nroff's behaviour for configure - it no longer
    accepts /dev/null as an input file (thanks, Fumitoshi UKAI;
    closes: #76107, #83019).

  * Updated policy version to 3.5.1:
    - Added build dependencies (closes: #61198). This includes a
      build-depends on libdb2-dev after its split from glibc in glibc 2.2,
      so there's now no need for special handling (closes: #41915).
    - Support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Clean the source package properly. As per the changelog comment in
    2.3.17-2, I'll leave configure and makefile there, but other generated
    files need to be removed or autobuilders may have random problems.
  * Rename /usr/bin/wrapper to /usr/bin/man-wrapper until somebody makes it
    generic (closes: #60084).
  * Make man-db almost lintian-clean:
    - Strip binaries.
    - Wrote a brief man page for man-wrapper.
    - Make /usr/bin/man and /usr/bin/mandb symlinks to man-wrapper to avoid
      the mess of creating hardlinks in the postinst, which broke md5sums as
      far as lintian was concerned. With statoverrides this doesn't leave a
      window where man and mandb are setuid root.
  * Check arguments to maintainer scripts so we don't do things like calling
    mandb on a failed upgrade (closes: #60867).
  * The test '-x $(which foo)' doesn't always do something predictable.
    Replace it with better idioms where the maintainer scripts use it.
  * perl-base is essential, so no need to check for perl being available.
  * util-linux is essential, so no need to check for more being available.

  * Fix segfault where apropos couldn't find an identifying string for a man
    page (thanks, Les Schaffer; closes: #71797).
  * Don't throw away errors in cron.weekly (closes: #28828).
  * Make -s option to mandb really not check for stray cats
    (closes: #78086).
  * Run cron.daily as user man; mandb is already wrapped by man-wrapper, so
    cron.weekly is fine (thanks, Wolfram Kleff; closes: #72292).
  * If a gzip subprocess is interrupted and we clean up the temp file, make
    sure we don't try to do it again in the atexit() hook (closes: #84926).
  * Add another chdir() so that 'man -l' with a relative path to a
    compressed man page works again.

man-db (2.3.17-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Commented away call to distclean_root in GNUmakefile: need to leave
    the Makefile and configure in the tarball.
  * Found and fixed subtle bug which made wrapper uselessly linked with
    -ldb2. When invoked by root on a system which enables group.db, then
    the call to initgroups() segfaults due to the libc link to libdb!
    This closes: #65474.

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Fri,  7 Apr 2000 10:50:45 +0300

man-db (2.3.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected apparent disappearing of option -e in apropos.
  * Corrected wrong usage of undocumented option -X which produced error
    when passed to filters. This is now parametrized as optional
    argument, defaulting to use devX75.  Documented in usage :
        -X = -TX75, -X100 = -TX100, -X100-12 = -TX100-12.
  * Applyed patch submitted by Tomohiro KUBOTA:
    * roff_device and LESSCHARSET are determined by user environment rather
      than language of manpage for English manpage.
    * roff_device "ascii8" is used for non-English/non-ISO-8859-1 languages.
    Tomohiro KUBOTA <kubota@debian.or.jp>  Sat, 22 Apr 2000 14:48:48 +0900
    closes: #62844.
    Because of this patch, changed versioned dependency to new groff.
  * Added new check for libdb in configure.in
  * Added /usr/local/{share/}man to config file, due to bug in FHS,
    thanx to Gregor Hoffleit. Closes: #61058.
  * Added new message catalog po file for cs (czech) (4 new messages),
    thanx to Vladimir Michl.
  * tired of people continously complaining that man behaves differently
    than in RedHat (which is "The Reference Linux", you all know that),
    I'll add tbl as default filter for man. This will fix those three
    or four manpages that do not take the burden to declare their
    dependency on the tbl formatter (usually because upstream uses
    RedHat and so ...). Now what would I do if someone fill a bug
    against this because of wasting of CPU cicles for un-necessary
    filtering on the hundreds of pages that do not need tbl? I would
    certainly agree with them. Therefore I will fix this introducing
    scanning of manpages a la grog in mandb, and storing the result in
    the database.  ...[noise of hacking and debugging]...  Well, I did
    it (use accessdb to see it!). It took 4 weekend (stolen to the
    implementation of man 2.4) to complete and debug. Now you can
    announce the world that man-db 2.3.17 knows in advance which filters
    to run when processing a manpage which is in the database.
    This rant closes: #63497; be happy!:wq

  * Backport another security fix from unstable.
  * Count how many times privileges have been dropped, and don't regain them
    until regain_effective_privs() is called the same number of times. The
    lack of nesting meant it was still possible to create files owned by uid

    search of trnlated manpages before giving the first english one

  * Just recompiled, with an upgraded potato system.
    Let's see if this wipes away the grave installation problem listed
    in bugs #60339, #60399, #60411, #60515.
    In that case, I'll close these bugs by hand :-)

man-db (2.3.12) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied security patch for forcing regeneration of secure temp file
    instead of reusing it. Thanx to Colin Phipps who audited it and
    submitted a patch. Closes: #58271.
  * Written new wrapper in C. It installs as /usr/bin/wrapper and is
    hardlinked to man and mandb while configuring. The package installs
    a one line script (as /usr/bin/man and /usr/bin/mandb) that simply
    inform that the package is not configured; it is removed by postinst
    and replaced by hardlinks with /usr/bin/wrapper.
    Thanx to Ethan Benson, Colin Phipps.
  * Simply incremented minor number, to make Josip Rodin happy.
    Not only it is a native Debian package, but is is also a "new
    upstream release"(TM)  :-)  (and yes, I've changed the version
    number also in configure.in :-)
  * Added explicit proto in straycat.c as now libc has canonicalize_file_name().

man-db (2.3.10-70) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * security fix: moved setuid binaries to /usr/lib/man-db and added
    shell wrapper to execute as user nobody when invoked by root.
    This would avoid having anybody running man as root, or cron running
    mandb.
  * Added more granularity in the "quietness" of mandb, and added option
    test to simply check the correctness of manpages, to allow lintian
    and/or dh_install_manpages to report warnings.
  * fixed a typo in spanish message catalog.
    Thanx to Jose Dapena Paz, closes: #56204.
  * added (but not enabled) new option -H (-Thtml) to take advantage of
    new html driver (still experimental but getting better) in groff.
  * as a consequence, added versioned dependency to groff >= 1.15
  * corrected location of GPL in copyright file.

  * removed setuid permissions from file in tarball, as postinst handle
    them properly. Closes #32213.
  * changed the copyright file to point out that the author has passed
    maintainership. Also changed location of his ftp site.
    closes #41737, #30153.
  * found (and fixed) nasty bug in reading config file that 
    segfaulted on too large files. Now stops reading and procede.
  * Added japanese support. Thanx to Taketoshi
    Sano <sano@debian.org> and Fumitoshi UKAI <ukai@debian.or.jp>.
    Closes: Bug#38107.
  * partially eliminated feature to display file when manpage is
    not found, limiting it only when the argument is a pathname
    containing the character '/'.
    closes: #41205, #41715, #45979.
  * created perl script /usr/lib/man-db/chconfig that scans the 
    file in argument (the man confile) and upgrade it to FHS.
    Its call from postinst is checked also against perl presence.
  * removed /etc/manpath.config from conffiles;
    added in postinst automatic copy of it if the existing one isn't
    being modified, or using the new script to validate it and upgrade
    to FHS. Treat correctly absence of the config file (??) and allow
    insertion of keyword NOFHS in /etc/manpath.config to avoid its
    update.
  * added list of md5sums from previous conffiles, to help detect
    unmodified ones. Added to rules file the automatic adding of 
    a new md5 if a new conffile is created. 
    (so maintainers don't have to maintain it)
  * added Japanese message catalog, curtesy of
    Fumitoshi UKAI <ukai@debian.or.jp>; closes: bug#43845.

man-db (2.3.10-69i) unstable; urgency=low

  * In man-db -69i:	
  * In man-db -69FIX.1:	
   * Added unlink of temporary file between call to tempnam and open to
     reduce (without completely avoiding it) the possibility that a
     malicious user puts a dangling symlink to let man leave a file
     (with a manpage inside :-) in places different that the temporary
     directory. Not a security risk at all, IMO.
   * Added secure open of temporary file in zsoelim.l , thanx to
     Marc Heuse <marc@suse.de>. The code was not secure against a
     symlink attack. This didn't affect 'man', which does not excute
     that part of the code, but only manual execution of zsoelim.

   * updated manual page man(1), example section, to make more clear
     that man -k and man -f *runs* apropos and whatis.
     Closes: #35741.
   * updated usage string and manual page for apropos, to reflect the
     use of -r as default, and the addition of -e to get the previous

     unavailable for configure. Thanx to UNO Takeshi <uno@sysplan.co.jp>
     for the report and the patch. Closes: #35608.
   * Added ability to suppose -l when no manpage is available; this
     enhancement was requested in bug#19999 and #23567
   * Added patch to fix bug#25270 (uninitialized var which made ignore
     the config file) thanx to cph@martigny.ai.mit.edu (Chris Hanson)
     for the report and the patch. This problem was also described by
     Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de> in bug #30646.
   * made czech message catalog available. When for manpages?
  * In man-db -69f:	Thu,  1 Apr 1999 16:17:58 +0300
   * corrected bug in manp.c introduced in 69e (missing xstrdup).
     My apologizes. Closes: #35326, #35353, #35354 .
     I hope it fixes also #35355 and #35336, but as I wasn't able to
     reproduce it, I'm not able to test its fix :-)
   * corrected typo in mandb.8 (/omitted/emitted/) (I remember having
     fixed it already ... maybe I'm getting too old?)
   * added message catalog in czech translated last year by 
     Vladimir.Michl@upol.cz and added using the wrong format and 
     later forgot. How can I be forgiven?
  * In man-db -69e:
   * Corrected typo in german messages file, thanx to Christian Hammers
     <ch@lathspell.westend.com> for the hint.
   * added enhancement to get manpath add default values from config
     file to value in MANPATH env var according to presence of redundant
     semicolon; suggested by Peter Moulder <reiter@netspace.net.au> in
     wishlist bug#19999.
     TODO:
     modify manpage, manual and so to describe new enhancement to
     $MANPATH management; trailing or leading spare semicolon make add
     the manpath derived from config files to the content of the var. A
     double semicolon in the middle of the var makes insertion of the
     rules derived into the var.
   * added management of a user conf file ~/.manpath , with the same
     syntax of /etc/manpath.conf, whose content is added to the default
     conf file. It remains to be demonstrated if handling of cache works
     as expected in all cases.
     This enhancement, binded with the previous one, gives users
     complete control over user managed mapages, which is quite more
     needed out of Linux, in other OSes.
  * In man-db -69d:
   * Wrong change in manpath.config: it built two indexes for /usr/man
     and /usr/share/man, and put both in /var/cache/man , so the second
     overwrote the first. Thanx to Matthew Eaton, closes: #34636.
  * In man-db -69c:
   * put back the config file into /etc ... :-)
   * found a bug in postinst that didn't rebuild the index.

   * modifyed cron.daily 
   * moved configuration file to /etc/menu/
     created list of sections in /etc/menu/sections.list
     The idea is to have mandb create it when scanning manpages.
   * FHS compliance:

        code, as it was a hack messing up names.
    - start installing manpages in /usr/share/man
      Don't worry about old packages installing into /usr/man .
      man is designed to search pages on several directories!
    - modify {pre,post}{inst,rm} scripts.

     default, even in absence of the env POSIXLY_CORRECT.
     Added option -e (--exact ) to permit the previous behaviour,
     when the keywords match only full words in the descriptions.
     Modifyed the usage of man and apropos.
     Need to modify the manpages and the manual.
     Thanx to Ian Jackson who posted the suggestion eons ago.
     (should fix: #3788 )
  * TODO:
   * To fix bug #5360 (which is not a bug in man-db) I want to create 
     a manpage installer program that checks all the common errors 
     in manpages like broken symlinks, wrong section, wrong location,
     missing of preprocessor directive in the first line and missing 
     of .SH NAME section.  
     This installer should also execute mandb to update the database (as
     when man -u is issued), as the automatic detection of new manpages
     doesn't work in case of multiple pages with the same name in
     different sections (#10106).  This update should be done in
     background after dpkg has finished.
   * to fix bug #3766 ("man" acting too smart) I need to take out of the
     sources the list of sections, and put it into the configuration
     file. This is not trivial, as the list is dinamic, but mandb scans
     all the pages in the system to collect descriptions, so I can use
     that code to collect the list of sections, order it and write it
     somewhere (=/var/cache/man/sections). Then man sources the list.
   * I need to add an option to show the order in which sections are
     processed while searching for a page. Actually this list is
     hardwired in the source code. It should be in the config file AND
     dinamically extended by mandb (which finds new sections). Splitting
     the config file into a directory would improve this? Yes.
   * For bug #11848 I should download glib sources, apply patches and
     then look into "locale" source code to see how and from where it
     takes the informations printed in line 'ctype-codeset-name' when I
     issue the command 'locale -k LC_CTYPE'; then reproduce this inside
     man.c and check the result. --ascii option should be assumed for
     ISO8859 different from -0, -1, -3, -7, -9 .

man-db (2.3.10-67) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected messaging for dangling symlink; also added correct
    handling of return codes, so now there will be only one warning line
    for each dangling symlink. (Thanx to Joey Hess, closes: #26141)
  * Added forcing of umask to avoid uncorrect settings of catdirs.
  * Added code to check for each single subcatdir, but, due to major
    load, conditioned code only to mandb. That is to say that catdirs
    are automagically created only by mandb. 
  * Removed "access" check in mandb which use the real user, making the
    setuid binary a non-sense.

man-db (2.3.10-65) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * added correction to spanish translations supplied by Santiago Vila.
    (closes: #21240)
  * Added a check for the availability of the executable "mail" otherway the
    postinst could fail.
  * Modifyed the check for update-menus to be on a single line for lintian,
    and to have safe exit point for failure of test.
  * Cleaned cron.weekly from call to the no-more existent utility mkcatdirs,
    whose presence make people (actually me, which is even worse) think that
    catpages were purged weekly, which is no more the case since 2.3.10-60
    Also lowered (from 7 to 6) the days of non-access to purge catpages,
    because the weekly access for rebuilding the database would always keep
    the atime lower than 7. (Thanx to Nicolás Lichtmaier for having tampered
    me untill I noticed that :-)

  * problems with i18n: added explicit check of environment instead of
    trusting setlocale(); now man works with translated manpages.
  * moved umask 022 from the shell command to the open of the temporary
    file, to avoid errors in case of restrictive settings, due to the
    open call added in -60

  * man-db (2.3.10-59bo61) bo-unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed test in configure to fail if executed without a pager on a
    Debian system.
  * To avoid the error "pager: No such file" when a newer man is used
    without upgrading any of the pagers in the system, I have added a
    bogus pager "/usr/sbin/man-pager", which points to /bin/more,
    installed through update-alternatives with a weight very light (1).
    Probably the Right-Thing-To-Do (TM) is to add a VP "pager" and ask
    all pager installing /usr/bin/pager to Provide: it (at least
    util-linux). Later man-db could Depends: on it  :-)

  * slightly modifyed manpath(1) manpage to reflect changes in manpath
    behaviour (back in version 2.3.10-39, #10039) about search for man
    hierarchy in the current directory. Udated english, italian and
    spanish pages; german ones are very old and need a complete reread.
  * added (in src/manp.c) creation of catman hierarchies -on-the-fly-,
    thus obsoleting all those scripts like mkcatdirs, and also modifying
    pre,post scripts.  (closes: #15518, #14449);
  * added checks in configure.in to determine if run on a debian system,
    defining DEBIAN, DEBVER, DEBMAINT and putting them in config.h ;
    removed old way to insert debian version number in the program.
  * cleaned cron files (closes: #14810, #18208).
  * (lintian): updated the debian/copyright file for FSF address;
    deleted copyright of gencat utility (no more in binary).
  * added a safer open for temp file in create_ztemp(), closes: #16371
  * corrected menu file, (closes: #17352).
  * added local date support for translated manpages into configure.in
    and in the manpages (idea by Luis Francisco Gonzalez).
  * added spanish manpages and catalogs
      (thanx to Luis Francisco Gonzalez <luisgh@cogs.susx.ac.uk>,
      Enrique Zanardi <ezanardi@noah.dfis.ull.es>
      and Cesar BALLARDINI <cballard@santafe.com.ar> ).

man-db (2.3.10-30) unstable; urgency=low

    * Installed german manpages and message catalogs.
    * In postinst added search for languages installed to build catmans
       also for them.
    * Added /usr/sbin/chmanconfig, a perl script that updates
       /etc/manpath.conf for the listed language, and calls mkcatdirs to
       update the catdir hierarchy.
       This is to be used by packages that install translated manpages.
    * Closes Bug#5977: (strange bug in man causes magically unpredictable
       manpage ?) due to change in database library and my inability to
       reproduce this behaviour.
    * Changed output of these messages from stdout to stderr (#4207):
       "What manual page do you want from section ?";
       "What manual page do you want?";
       "No source manual entry for ";
       "No manual entry for ";
    * added in cron.weekly the update of catdirs hierarchy and forced
       complete rebuild of indexes (instead of simple update)
    * Installs tools/mkcatdirs in /usr/sbin ; this script can be used
       (and is used in postinst) to build the catman hierarchy
       that now is made on the fly instead than burn in the package.
       Modifyed to make also main catdirs (not only subdirs)
    * preinst and postrm both remove the whole catman hierarchy.
    * postinst builds the catman hierarchy using mkcatdirs or a basic
       set of dirs predefined, and then builds the index databases.
    * Provides: man, man-browser. Conflicts: man. Replaces: man.
       These should remove the old man package as well as the man-aeb.
    * Compiled using option nls=all (all locales).
    * Linked against libdb1 (Berkeley) instead of gdbm.
    * Compiled using libc5 5.4.20
    * Changed name from man to man-db, to follow upstream (man_db)
       this also fixes bug #4885 (/usr/doc/man gets man itself confused)
    * Added man_db-manual-0.5.cat (which was distributed separetely) as
       /usr/doc/man-db-manual.txt
    * Rebuilt using debmake (Standards-Version: 2.1.2.2) resulting in a
       smaller debian/rules file (but not more explicative).
