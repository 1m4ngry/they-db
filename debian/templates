Template: man-db/install-setuid
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Should man and mandb be installed 'setuid man'?
 The man and mandb program can be installed with the set-user-id bit set, so
 that they will run with the permissions of the 'man' user. This allows
 ordinary users to benefit from the caching of preformatted manual pages
 ('cat pages'), which may aid performance on slower machines.
 .
 Cached man pages only work if you are using an 80-column terminal, to avoid
 one user causing cat pages to be saved at widths that would be inconvenient
 for other users. If you use a wide terminal, you can force man pages to be
 formatted to 80 columns anyway by setting MANWIDTH=80.
 .
 Enabling this feature may be a security risk, so it is disabled by default.
 If in doubt, you should leave it disabled.

Template: man-db/build-database
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Should mandb build its database now?
 You do not yet have a database of manual page descriptions. Building one
 may take some time, depending on how many pages you have installed; it
 will happen in the background, possibly slowing down the installation of
 other packages.
 .
 If you do not build the database now, it will be built the next time
 /etc/cron.weekly/man-db runs (automatically or manually). Until then,
 the 'whatis' and 'apropos' commands will not be able to display any
 output.

Template: man-db/rebuild-database
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Should mandb build its database now?
 This version of man-db is incompatible with your existing database of
 manual page descriptions, so that database needs to be rebuilt. This may
 take some time, depending on how many pages you have installed; it will
 happen in the background, possibly slowing down the installation of other
 packages.
 .
 If you do not build the database now, it will be built the next time
 /etc/cron.weekly/man-db runs (automatically or manually). Until then,
 the 'whatis' and 'apropos' commands will not be able to display any
 output.
 .
 Incompatible changes like this should happen rarely.
